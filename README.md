# Article-Scraper
# News You Need

### Overview

This site was created using Express, Node.js, Mongodb, Mongoose, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Cheerio.

The site allows a user to scrape headlines by clicking the 'scrape' button. The site then renders several articles. It shows the headline, a summary and a link to the full article. It then allows the user to save articles, by switching a saved value from false (default) to true. When the user goes to the saved page, they can see all the articles they've saved. They can then delete them from their saved page if they choose to do so. They can also submit a note to be saved alongside that article.
